      My name is Juliana Vargas and I am a photography student at San Jose State University.
      When I was 12, my dad gave me my first camera. That was when my passion
      for photography started. I grew up in Costa Rica and I was lucky enough
      to grow up in a house with a very large garden which meant that I had my
      own little world to explore. I enjoyed being able to capture what was around
      me in my own way. Growing up as a very shy person, I really liked being able to
      communicate with others through my images without needing to talk.<br /><br />Once
      I graduated high school, I was a hundred percent sure that I wanted to study
      photography. I moved back to Los Angeles, CA less than a month after I graduated
      to pursue my photographic studies. Through my courses, I started to really enjoy
      taking still life photography. I started to merge the use of color and compositing
      to create visually interesting still life photos. The use of color, as a main component
      of my photos, and compositing are still present throughout my work, even in those
      that aren’t still life photos.<br /><br />Some of the concepts I come up with for my
      works have a message I am trying to transmit to the viewer, but not all of them do.
      Some of my works focus on themes that I think aren’t addressed as much as they should
      be and/or themes that relate to my life. Sometimes, however, I just want to create
      visually intriguing and engaging images. Either way, whether there is a message or
      there isn’t, I want my work to make the viewers find themselves in a place between
      familiarity and discomfort. Ultimately, I wish to inspire others to explore and
      expand their own way of viewing the world.
